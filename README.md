## Broader Project Summary
**Title**: [Nevada Water Resources Initiative](http://water.nv.gov/documents/NDWR_Strategic-Plan_FY23-27.pdf)

**Major Goals**: The primary goals will be to estimate water use across the state associated with
agriculture and natural groundwater discharge areas, and perform data collection and
monitoring that will be used for water use model development and validation. These estimates
will be foundational for updating groundwater withdrawals, consumptive use, water budgets, and
future hydrologic modeling activities across the state. Additional activities in collaboration with
Nevada Division of Water Resources (NDWR) and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will focus on
providing climate, water use, and Geographic Information System (GIS) data and analyses to
support groundwater recharge, water availability, and water demand assessments across the
state, and water budget assessments in priority basins.
